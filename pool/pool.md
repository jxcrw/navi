## Pro Player Observations
- `2023/08/04` Many musicians suggest that anything more than ≈4 hours of practice a day is [too much](http://www.bulletproofmusician.com/how-many-hours-a-day-should-you-practice/).
- `2023/07/26` Max Eberle said he once went 5 years straight without missing a single day of practice.
- `2023/04/14` GM Hikaru says that securing alternative income stream (in form of streaming) improved his chess performance by eliminating the financial pressure to perform well. He's already earning income, so whatever happens at the match or tournament doesn't really matter, he just gets to enjoy the games.
- `2023/03/03` 2023 Predator World 10 Ball B-side round 1. Jun Kwon Ho misses routine but just slightly difficult 10 ball and hangs it in another pocket hill hill after brilliant run of entire rack to lose match and get eliminated. Packs up and leaves without a word.
- `2023/02/20` Corey Deuel [gets a ton of draw on the cue ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCjdtKcvao) with very slow cue speed and pretty short stroke length.
- `2023/02/20` Corey Deuel's hands [were shaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCjdtKcvao) when he super elevates to cue at a cue ball frozen to the object ball.
- `2018/04/23` Under pressure we don't rise to the occasion, we sink to the level of our training.
- `2018/04/22` John Schmidt on [winning mentality](https://youtu.be/u8KsVm9ePlk?t=1h11m7s). "No one wants you to win except you."
- `2018/04/22` John Schmidt/Corey Deuel on [financial realities of pool](https://youtu.be/u8KsVm9ePlk?t=51m37s). "Have to be one of best on earth just to squeak by."


## Thoughts/Connections
- `2023/05/14` Pool is like fitness. You've not trained in 12 years, you're pool-fat. You can't be ripped today. But you can be ripped in a few years if you hit the pool-gym every day starting today.
- `2023/05/14` Pool is like lifting. You don't do exactly the same lifts every day, you shouldn't do exactly the same drills every day.



## Book/Interview Notes
### `2022/04/07` [PPP - Alex Pagulayan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLkNsOeGz3M)
- Just gambled until he couldn't get a game anymore before going on tournament circuit.
- Every player gets nervous. If they tell you they don't, they're full of shit.
- Some people out there care too much about who's better. Who gives a fuck, just play everybody.
- If you want to really grow in the game, you have to go beyond your capability, go outside your turf.
- There's no shortcuts in the game. People tell you you're a natural, but they'd be a natural too if they played 10 hours a day for five years.
- Sees many players play the same speed for 20 years - they think they're practicing but they're just banging balls.


### `2022/04/03` [PPP - Shane Van Boening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egKzhBSl9S8)
- My advice to young kids? Stay in school.
- Pool is financially difficult. Cost me $3k to get here to Vegas. I'm stuck $3k before I even hit a ball.
- I absolutely don't enjoy 1P. You can't be a world champion at 1P. I got a few years left in my career (age 39).
- It's [pool] been the same since the IPT. If it doesn't get better, I gotta give up pool. There are better things to do. Go fishin'.
- Top snooker player makes $20 million in their career. I've made $2 million in 15 years.
    + One of the best on planet earth, $2 million in 15 years ⇒ ≈$133k per year.
- Shane absolutely doesn't notice amateur players like Joey Ryan. They don't even register on his radar.


### `2022/04/03` [PPP - Mike Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivZtNJ9ilXw)
- Best year made ≈$95k. Bad years made ≈$50k. Expenses usually ~$30k.


### `~2019` Daigo Umehara Will to Keep Winning
- Experienced feelings of doubt, did competitive gaming before it was even a thing.
- Was also interested in pool and mahjong.
- Achieved top level mahjong play by shadowing a top player for 3 years.
- Washed out of mahjong after 3 years at age 26, felt like had nothing yet spent all his time playing games.
- Partly blamed father for not showing him a better path to life while making him do something more productive.
- Made impulsive decisions about starting/stopping gaming, starting/stopping mahjong, starting elderly care career.
- Started elderly care because easy career with no prior experience and he could ask his parents for questions and advice.
- Felt like spirit was broken and that he was giving up and settling by getting into elderly care.
- Thought that helping people and working with others would bring some meaning and happiness to his life.
- Working hard in normal job every day brought confidence and self-fulfillment which in turn brought ambition.
- Felt really good after coming home from a long day of hard work in elderly care.
- Got back into gaming kind of like coincidence when Street fighter 4 was released.
- Securing a sponsor allowed him to enjoy games fully without any feelings of insecurity or regret.
- The year-and-a-half he spent away from competitive gaming doing elderly care was really restorative.
- There's a difference between working hard for no reason and working hard and being productive about it.
- Hard work alone does not guarantee success, and hard work alone does not mean you deserve success
- 3 hours of practice a day is more than enough. More than that borders on inefficient.
- Routines are important, but should be flexible enough to accommodate natural changes in life.
- Tries to keep min/max happiness levels at about 6/10 and 8/10 because anything higher than that is unsustainable.
- Wakes up at 10am and goes to sleep at 3am.
