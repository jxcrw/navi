## 0 Introduction
### Origins of Tarot
- Painted in mid-15th century by Bonifacio Bembo for Visconti family of Milan for Italian game Tarocchi.
- Odd (coincidental?) connections to Jewish mysticism and occult knowledge called the Kabbalah.
- Number of major arcana (22) may correspond to number of letters in Hebrew alphabet.
- In 18th century, Antoine Court de Gebelin declared Tarot to be remnant of the Book of Thoth.
- In 19th century, Alphonse Louis Constant linked the cards to the Kabbalah.
- Cards have developed additional meanings and associations over time.
- Arthur Edward Waite + Pamela Colman Smith published Rider pack in 1910.

### Different Versions of Tarot
- RWS deck introduced scenes for all the cards (previously, minor arcana just had pipped cards).
- When the cards started to be used for divination is unclear.



## 1 The Four Card Pattern
### Unity and Duality
- Fool is 0, representing the absence of a well-defined number and therefore infinite possibility.
- Magician and Priestess are 1 and 2, the first genuine numbers.
- Fool splits into Magician and Priestess and then recombines back into the World at 21.
- Magician represents maleness (phallic wands), Priestess represents femaleness (vaginal pillars).



## 2 The Overview
### The Cards as a Sequence
- Can consider major arcana as separate entities or as sequence.
- Many people divide up the major arcana at Wheel of Fortune (10) because yields two even groups of 11.
- Can also divide up cards by removing Fool and using three groups of 7 (yields vertical correspondences).
    + Group 1 - "consciousness": The outer concerns of life in society.
    + Group 2 - "subconscious": The search inward to find out who we are.
    + Group 3 - "superconscious": The development of spiritual awareness and release of archetypal energy.
